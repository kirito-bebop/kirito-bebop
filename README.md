Hi, my name is Kirito. I'm the cowboy programmer.

My name is in honor of the SAO's protagonist.
Bebop is a musical style of jazz that developed in the 40s. Besides that, it's the name of one of the best animes "Cowboy Bebop".

My preferred programming language is Java followed by Python. But so far, I have not programmed anything interesting.. :S But I want to create a my own proyect:D
I use Linux, Ubuntu with Tiling Windows Manager. Now I'm testing Arch Linux. It's brillant!


Now, I'm learning integration PHP with MySQL.


NOTE: I LOVE all about of databases. End NOTE.
